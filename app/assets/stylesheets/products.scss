// Place all the styles related to the Products controller here.
// They will automatically be included in application.css.
// You can use Sass (SCSS) here: http://sass-lang.com/

body{
  font-family: Futura,"Trebuchet MS",Arial,sans-serif;
  background-image: url('confectionary.png')
}
//product_image is from the index page. The width is 100% of each well, not the page.
.product_image{
  width:100%;
}

/// another approach (that specifically shows the well connection):

//.well img {
//  width 100%;
//}
